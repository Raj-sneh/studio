/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Sargam App
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-related data
 * and allows public read access to lesson data. Write access to lessons and reports
 * is not granted through these rules, implying that these operations should be
 * handled via backend logic (e.g., Cloud Functions) with appropriate authorization.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. Only the user can read/write their own profile.
 * - /lessons/{lessonId}: Stores lesson details. Public read access is allowed.
 * - /users/{userId}/teacher_sessions/{sessionId}: Stores teacher session data. Only the user can read/write their own sessions.
 * - /reports/{reportId}: Stores reports submitted by users. Write access is not granted through these rules, implying backend management.
 * - /users/{userId}/blocks/{blockedId}: Stores block relationships between users. Only the user can create/delete blocks they initiated.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data under /users/{userId}.
 * - Lessons are publicly readable.
 * - Reports are not directly writable via client-side rules.
 * - List operations are generally restricted to the owner of the data, preventing unauthorized enumeration.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The current data model leverages path-based ownership, avoiding the need for denormalization.
 *  - If collaborative features are added in the future, denormalization of membership data onto shared documents will be necessary to avoid `get()` calls in rules.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  - User-specific data (teacher_sessions, blocks) is stored in user subcollections, providing clear segregation and ownership.
